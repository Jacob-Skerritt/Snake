# Snake
2-D snake game, created using Java Swing.

A simple Snake game expanded upon and developed into a full application with Menu system, HighScores, Nickname and additional game mechanics.
## Features:
- Fully navigable menu system with several core features.
  - Local Nickname creation
  - Local top 10 highscores
  - Several difficulties(speed settings) for the snake game.
- Additional game play features:
  - Bad Apple: creates an red apple for a short period of time, if the player collects the snake shrinks by half.
  - Whenever the score soubles the background colour will randomly change to 1 of 3 colours (black, grey, blue)
    - This feature was purely for learning and can and likely should be removed.
- Sound:
    - Backgorund music, continous loop, one song(royalty free)
    - Game over sounds, a sound that occurs when the player loses the game(royalty free)
    - Apple(good and bad) collision sound to indicate the player hit the apple (royalty free)
